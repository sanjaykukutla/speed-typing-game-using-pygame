Introduction-
The purpose of this project is to develop a typing

game that provides a fun and engaging way for
users to improve their typing skills. The game's
objective is to type words that appear on the
screen before they reach the bottom. The game
includes three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and
hard, with each level having a different number of
balls falling from up to down with varying speeds.

Design-
The game will have a simple and intuitive

interface, with the main game screen displaying a
background with clouds and balloons falling from
the top of the screen to the bottom.

The game will have three difficulty levels: easy,
medium, and hard. The easy level will have fewer
balls falling, while the hard level will have more
balls falling with increased speed. The difficulty

level can be chosen by the player at the start of
the game.

Mechanics and Working-
The game's mechanics will involve the player

typing the words that appear on the balloons as
they fall from the top of the screen to the bottom.
If a word is typed correctly and the spacebar is
clicked, the corresponding balloon will pop, and
the player will earn points. The game will end
after 60 seconds, and the player's score and
typing speed will be displayed.

The game will have sound effects, such as the
sound of balloons popping and music playing in
the background, to make the game more
engaging. The game will also have visual effects,
such as the balloons exploding into confetti when
popped, to make the game more fun.
